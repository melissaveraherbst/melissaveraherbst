# üëã Hi, I'm Mel!

I'm a Full Stack Developer based in captivating Cape Town, SA. My coding odyssey began during the initial months of the Covid pandemic, and since then, I've been entrenched in the world of web development and software engineering. Fuelled by countless cups of coffee and the more-often-than-not late-night debugging sessions, I've discovered an insatiable love for problem-solving and crafting digital applications.

Beyond coding, I find solace in the realm of gaming üéÆ and share an equal adoration for our feline and canine companions üê∂ü©µüò∫. 

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª My Expertise
Within the wide breadth of the software industry, I chose to focus on web development as a starting point because of its ubiquity and power. Additionally, Database Administration and Design, and Data Visualization have captured my interest. I currently specialize in the JavaScript programming language.

## üèÜ Projects
My GitHub serves as a canvas where I store and showcase my favourite projects and course work stemming from immersive online courses. These projects and course material emphasize fundamental computer science concepts and web development technologies, including JavaScript front- and backend technolgies, SQL and NoSQL databases, and data structures and algorithms. 

Here is a list of a few of my repositories containing my work:

* [Yelp Camp](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/yelp-camp_camp-review-web-app)  
A capstone project that is by far my favourite and perhaps most complete full stack project so far. I have put a lot of effort into this project going above and beyond the scope of the project requirements.
* [JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/javascript-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main)  
A collection of code and notes from the JavaScript DS&A Course on Udemy by Colt Steele
* [Jammming](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/jammming_spotify-playlist-manager)  
A Spotify playlist manager.
* [Budget Envelopes API](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/envelope-budget-api)

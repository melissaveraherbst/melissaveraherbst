## 🏆 Projects
My GitHub serves as a canvas where I store and showcase my favourite projects and course work stemming from immersive online courses. These projects and course material emphasize fundamental computer science concepts and web development technologies, including JavaScript front- and backend technolgies, SQL and NoSQL databases, and data structures and algorithms. 

Here is a list of a few of my repositories containing my work:

* [Yelp Camp](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/yelp-camp_camp-review-web-app)  
A capstone project that is by far my favourite and perhaps most complete full stack project so far. I have put a lot of effort into this project going above and beyond the scope of the project requirements.
* [JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/javascript-data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main)  
A collection of code and notes from the JavaScript DS&A Course on Udemy by Colt Steele
* [Jammming](https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/jammming_spotify-playlist-manager)

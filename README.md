# üëã Hi, I'm Mel!

I'm a Full Stack Developer based in captivating Cape Town, SA. My coding odyssey began during the initial months of the Covid pandemic, and since then, I've been entrenched in the world of web development and software engineering. Fuelled by countless cups of coffee and the more-often-than-not late-night debugging sessions, I've discovered an insatiable love for problem-solving and crafting digital applications.

Beyond coding, I find solace in the realm of gaming üéÆ and share an equal adoration for our feline and canine companions üê∂ü©µüò∫. 

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª My Expertise
Within the wide breadth of the software industry, I chose to focus on web development as a starting point because of its ubiquity and power. Additionally, Database Administration and Design, and Data Visualization have captured my interest. I currently specialize in the JavaScript programming language.
